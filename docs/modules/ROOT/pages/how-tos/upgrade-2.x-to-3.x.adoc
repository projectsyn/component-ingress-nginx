= Upgrade from 2.x to 3.x

This guide describes the steps to perform an upgrade of the component from version 2.x to 3.x.

== Introduction

The component version 3.x uses a new parameter `kubernetes_version`, which has to be set to kubernetes version of the control plane that's used on the cluster.
Setting this variable, ensures that the helm chart is rendered for the correct kubernetes version.




== Step-by-step guide

. Before upgrading to the latest version, ensure that you have set the `kubernetes_version` parameter in your inventory as follows:

+
[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  ingress_nginx:
    kubernetes_version: '1.20'
----
+

[WARNING]
Setting this variable, might cause a few changes, because the helm chart was rendered for a wrong kubernetes version before (especially true for cluster <= 1.20)
