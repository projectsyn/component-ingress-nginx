= Upgrade from 7.x to 8.x

This guide describes the steps to perform an upgrade of the component from version 7.x to 8.x.

== Introduction

The helm chart v4.4.0 did introduce a change[https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/commit/249780737c862a7cf690058511ee7126ddd0d788] of the `election-id` from `ingress-controller-leader` to `ingress-nginx-leader`.
Changing the electionID might cause a ingress service interrupt until all NGINX Ingress components have been upgraded.
During the upgrade the leader might not be choosen correctly.

== Step-by-step guide

. Before upgrading to the latest version, you can optionally add following config to preserve the original electionID naming:

+
[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  ingress_nginx:
    helm_values:
      controller:
        electionID: ingress-controller-leader
----
+

[WARNING]
Not preserving the electionID might cause a downtime on the ingress path!
