= Upgrade from 3.x to 4.x

This guide describes the steps to perform an upgrade of the component from version 3.x to 4.x.

== Introduction

The component version 4.x uses the image registry source of `registry.k8s.io` instead of `k8s.gcr.io`.
There are no other changes.

== Step-by-step guide

If you have restricted the external cluster communication, please change and verify the ability to pull from `registry.k8s.io`.
Allowance on `k8s.gcr.io` can be removed depending on other components pulling from there.

== Why

`k8s.gcr.io` is deprecated in favor of `registry.k8s.io`:
